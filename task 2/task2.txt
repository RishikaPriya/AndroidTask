Problem Statement: 
Optimise the database : Make an app that download all of the files and store it in database in the android app locally.


Approach:
1. Downloading Files
For downloading the files, I have used volley library.


1. Processing Response From Volley (html file content)
        The response from volley was stored in string object. Using Jsoup Library, extracted the 
        content between paragraph the tag and inserted in database. This reduced the
         response processing.


1. Storing in Database
Room database is used for storing the content.


1. Calculation of execution time
        To calculate the execution time for each submission, the difference between the time as 
soon as we receive the response and after the insert query for database is called is 
taken into consideration.
